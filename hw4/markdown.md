# General
## Example

Cpp-Markdown is a freely-available Markdown text-to-HTML translator, written in
C++, intended for integration into C++ programs rather than for use in web
applications.

It differs from other Markdown translators in a few ways:

* It's written in C++, making full use of C++ constructs such as classes,
  inheritance, I/O streams, and namespaces. This means that you get the full
  speed advantages of a compiled language, as well as easier integration into
  C++ programs.
